## My Gallup CliftonStrengths Assessment

_**You Lead With Strategic Thinking CliftonStrengths themes**_

Leaders with great Strategic Thinking strengths are the ones who keep us all focused on what could be. They are constantly absorbing and analyzing information and helping the team make better decisions. People with strength in this domain continually stretch our thinking for the future.

1. **Restorative:** People exceptionally talented in the Restorative theme are adept at dealing with problems. They are good at figuring out what is wrong and resolving it.
2. **Analytical:** People exceptionally talented in the Analytical theme search for reasons and causes. They have the ability to think about all of the factors that might affect a situation.
3. **Ideation:** People exceptionally talented in the Ideation theme are fascinated by ideas. They are able to find connections between seemingly disparate phenomena.
4. **Futuristic:** People exceptionally talented in the Futuristic theme are inspired by the future and what could be. They energize others with their visions of the future.
5. **Learner:** People exceptionally talented in the Learner theme have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. The process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites them.

## Perceived Strengths:

- **Researching**: Especially new ways of doing things in the context of pain points
- **Learning how things work**: I have an innate desire to understand how things work. I need to feel I understand enough context before I feel prepared to solution.
- **Improving Processes**: Creating, retiring, and refining processes to help teams be more effective.
- I cherish constructive feedback when delivered appropriately.
- **Perceptive.**
- **Detail-Oriented.**
- **Methodical & Thoughtful.**

## Known Weaknesses

I'm working on them and welcome any constructive advice:

- **Perfectionism.** To overcome this, I do well when paired with someone who is action-oriented. I also do well when I have a little too much on my plate so that I’m forced to take action. I also have to remind myself that [Done is better than Perfect](/docs/principles/done-is-better-than-perfect.md).
- **Analysis paralysis**: Sometimes I can get stuck when I see too many paths forward and no clear best option. In these times, being paired with someone action-oriented helps me focus and pick one of the least bad approaches.
- **Procrastinating**: Sometimes I procrastinate tasks when I have incomplete information or don't know how to complete a task.
- **Conflict avoidance**: As a manager, I’ve had to learn to become more direct, especially when providing negative feedback. I don’t enjoy it, but I’m getting more comfortable with it. This has led me to [Be kind, not nice](/principles/be-kind-not-nice).
- **Impatient at times.** e.g. When it takes minutes to say what could be said in seconds; when people waste time rehashing what’s already known; when people don’t invest in their personal growth; when people obstruct. Don’t tell me why something is not possible; help me find a way to do it anyway. I have to remind myself that [people are not their behaviors](/docs/principles/people-are-not-their-behaviors).
