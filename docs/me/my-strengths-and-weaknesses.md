# Work with Me

_I make engineers and engineering organizations better._

## I Excel:

- When given time to read, reflect, and apply what I'm learning.
- When put in a role where I can use (and grow) my knowledge to help others solve problems.

## Key Motivations and Drives

- Driven to understand how things work.
- Driven to be the best version of myself in all areas of life.
- Always learning.
- Desire to be surrounded by the best people possible that I can learn from.
- Driven to make my engineering organization the best it can be.
- Motivated to always improve and support the people, processes, and systems in my circle of influence.
- Finishing things makes me feel accomplished. Learning things makes me feel excited. Helping others makes me feel fulfilled.

## Perceived Strengths:

- **Researching**: Especially new ways of doing things in the context of pain points
- **Learning how things work**: I have an innate desire to understand how things work. I need to feel I understand enough context before I feel prepared to solution.
- **Improving Processes**: Creating, retiring, and refining processes to help teams be more effective.
- I cherish constructive feedback when delivered appropriately.
- **Perceptive.**
- **Detail-Oriented.**
- **Methodical & Thoughtful.**

## Known Weaknesses

I'm working on them and welcome any constructive advice:

- **Perfectionism.** To overcome this, I do well when paired with someone who is action-oriented. I also do well when I have a little too much on my plate so that I’m forced to take action. I also have to remind myself that [Done is better than Perfect](/docs/principles/done-is-better-than-perfect.md).
- **Analysis paralysis**: Sometimes I can get stuck when I see too many paths forward and no clear best option. In these times, being paired with someone action-oriented helps me focus and pick one of the least bad approaches.
- **Procrastinating**: Sometimes I procrastinate tasks when I have incomplete information or don't know how to complete a task.
- **Conflict avoidance**: As a manager, I’ve had to learn to become more direct, especially when providing negative feedback. I don’t enjoy it, but I’m getting more comfortable with it. This has led me to [Be kind, not nice](/principles/be-kind-not-nice).
- **Impatient at times.** e.g. When it takes minutes to say what could be said in seconds; when people waste time rehashing what’s already known; when people don’t invest in their personal growth; when people obstruct. Don’t tell me why something is not possible; help me find a way to do it anyway. I have to remind myself that [people are not their behaviors](/docs/principles/people-are-not-their-behaviors).
