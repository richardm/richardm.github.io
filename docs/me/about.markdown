# About Richard Morgan

_I make software engineers and organizations better._

## Personal

Married to Hannah. Ambivert. I enjoy travel, and my ideal lifestyle would be spending a few months at a time in different parts of the world. Favorite places to spend a few months one day are the French Riviera, Poland, Eastern Europe (Belgrade, Kyiv, Chisinau), Mexico City, Puerto Vallarta, Denver, and Miami. A minimalist who loves living in dense, walkable areas while being within a couple hours of nature.

## Career Goals

Short-Mid Term Goals: Continue developing my strengths and learn the skills I’m missing to accomplish my long term goals. Specifically, learn how to lead and manage others effectively, how to motivate and inspire others, how to scale myself and demonstrate I can deliver results on a large scale. Fearful of losing technical skills.

My long-term goal is to co-found my own technology company building a B2C SaaS product that scales to millions of users. I enjoy working in mid-sized teams of 50-200

## Professional Background

As a software engineer and engineering manager with over 20 years of software engineering experience, I am comfortable wearing wearing either hat; however, I prefer not to wear both hats on the same team in order to coach and empower my team without micromanaging.

In my current role as Director of Software Engineering, I primarily help my department head support an organization of over 60 engineers. Over the past two decades, I've specialized--at various times--in backend development (PHP and Node.js), frontend development (Angular, React, Backbone.js, ExtJS, and TypeScript), web performance, and security.

In recent years, I’ve transitioned from actively leading software development and architecture as Lead Software Engineer, to managing software development teams and guiding our transition to microservices, to investing in people and developing engineering leaders.

Work-related interests include leadership, test automation, machine learning, application performance and security, functional programming, microservices and micro-frontends, automation, CI/CD and DevOps.

Outside of work, I enjoy photography, music, travel, and investing. I've spent several years abroad cumulatively and have traveled to nearly 50 countries and most US states. As a teenager, I played classical piano, and in high school, I was the drummer for a metal band. I also made multiple forays into politics, including running for Congress in TX-21, working as a software engineer for a major party presidential candidate during the 2012 general election, and running for the Dallas County Community College Board of Trustees in 2016.
