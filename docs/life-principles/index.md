## Life Principles

- **You can have anything you want, but you can't have everything you want.** See: [Prioritize, by Ray Dalio](https://www.principles.com/principles/b256de90-3a98-4e7d-8892-63af649dca60/){:target="\_blank"}
- Understand the difference between desires and goals. Goals are things you want to achieve (e.g. start a business, earn a six-figure salary, retire by age 65), while desires are (often short-term) things you want (e.g. health, money, comfort, security, etc.). **The key to success is to reconcile your goals with your desires.** See: [Have clear goals, by Ray Dalio](https://www.principles.com/principles/364aef43-b3e6-4159-ac16-8d7a012e2bc9/){:target="\_blank"}

## Principles for Success

- Knowing when not to bet is as important as knowing what bets to make
- Remember the Pareto Principle (the 80-20 rule) and identify the 20%
- **Fall in love with the problem, not the solution**
- **Fall in love with the journey, not the destination**
- **Live in the present.** The past is a memory, and the future is a fantasy. You can only act in the present, so be present.
- **Cultivate an abundance mindset.** A scarcity mindset is a trauma response that optimizes for conservation rather than growth.
- **Get to the point you can prioritize growth over conservation.** A scarcity mindset is a trauma response that forces you to conserve rather than to grow. Cultivate an abundance mindset focused on becoming all you can be.
- Surround yourself with people who are continually learning.
- Understand the impact of compounding and invest early in things that compound. It doesnâ€™t matter so much how much a person knows today as long as they are continuously learning.
