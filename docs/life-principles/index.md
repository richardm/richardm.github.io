## Life Principles

- **You can have anything you want, but you can't have everything you want.** See: [Prioritize, by Ray Dalio](https://www.principles.com/principles/b256de90-3a98-4e7d-8892-63af649dca60/){:target="\_blank"}
- Understand the difference between desires and goals. Goals are things you want to achieve (e.g. start a business, earn a six-figure salary, retire by age 65), while desires are (often short-term) things you want (e.g. health, money, comfort, security, etc.). **The key to success is to reconcile your goals with your desires.** See: [Have clear goals, by Ray Dalio](https://www.principles.com/principles/364aef43-b3e6-4159-ac16-8d7a012e2bc9/){:target="\_blank"}
