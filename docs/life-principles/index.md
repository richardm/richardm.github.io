## Life Principles

- **You can have anything you want, but you can't have everything you want.** See: [Prioritize, by Ray Dalio](https://www.principles.com/principles/b256de90-3a98-4e7d-8892-63af649dca60/){:target="\_blank"}
- Understand the difference between desires and goals. Goals are things you want to achieve (e.g. start a business, earn a six-figure salary, retire by age 65), while desires are (often short-term) things you want (e.g. health, money, comfort, security, etc.). **The key to success is to reconcile your goals with your desires.** See: [Have clear goals, by Ray Dalio](https://www.principles.com/principles/364aef43-b3e6-4159-ac16-8d7a012e2bc9/){:target="\_blank"}

## Principles for Success

- Knowing when not to bet is as important as knowing what bets to make
- Remember the Pareto Principle (the 80-20 rule) and identify the 20%
- **Fall in love with the problem, not the solution**
- **Fall in love with the journey, not the destination**
- **Live in the present.** The past is a memory, and the future is a fantasy. You can only act in the present, so be present.
- **Cultivate an abundance mindset.** A scarcity mindset is a trauma response that optimizes for conservation rather than growth.
- **Get to the point you can prioritize growth over conservation.** A scarcity mindset is a trauma response that forces you to conserve rather than to grow. Cultivate an abundance mindset focused on becoming all you can be.
- Surround yourself with people who are continually learning.
- Understand the impact of compounding and invest early in things that compound. It doesn’t matter so much how much a person knows today as long as they are continuously learning.

## Who to work with and where to work

- **Most adult learning occurs on the job.** Look for a job that uses the skills you want to develop, and look for a company that’s great at the skill you want to develop. What to become a good manager? Work at a place with great managers. Want to be a great investor? Work at a place with great investors. Want to become a great software engineer? Etc…
- Life is short, and we spend most of it at work.
- You become like the people you associate with most closely. Many of these people are coworkers. Choose those people carefully.
- Prioritize working with good people.
- Don’t work for jerks. Don’t work with jerks. Don’t hire jerks. (But remember, [people are not their behavior](/principles/people-are-not-their-behaviors). Do I need to refine this principle? Since this is a draft, I consider a “jerk” someone who repeatedly and consistently demonstrates a pattern of jerk-like behavior and disregard for others.)
- If you are a high achiever, seek to work in a place that values accountability.

## On Learning

> “When you’re memorizing something, it’s an indication that you don’t understand it. You should be able to re-derive anything on the spot and if you can’t, you don’t know it.” - Naval Ravikant

> **“Your resume is just a catalog of all your suffering.”** Nothing worthwhile in life comes without pain and suffering of some level

## On Happiness

- "Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get." - Dale Carnegie

> “Desire is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want” - Naval Ravikant

> “It’s in responsibility that most people find the meaning that sustains them through life. It’s not in happiness. It’s not in impulsive pleasure.” - Jordan Peterson
