# The Issues

This page originally served as a platform for my political campaign. In 2012, I ran for U.S. Congress against Lamar Smith, in an 11th hour campaign to raise awareness of the Stop Online Piracy Act. In 2016, I ran for the Dallas College Trustee, coming in second place and getting over 30% of the vote. While I am no longer active in Texas politics, I remain passionate about education, immigration, productivity, and technology issues. In the future, I will add more content around those issues.
