# Never punish honesty

As an engineering manager, I've been taken aback at times by the bluntness of my reports in volunteering information about how they've failed at times. At first, I was tempted to respond negatively, but I realized quickly that by reacting negatively, I would have [undermined their trust](/principles/earn-trust), which wouldn't necessarily prevent the behavior, but it would make it much more likely that next time they wouldn't tell me. I realized in the moment that [I would rather know the unpleasant truth than believe a false reality](https://www.principles.com/principles/35488158-a0bc-47c0-bc89-050c036d995e/){:target="\_blank"}.

Instead of reacting negatively in these conversations, I've learned to lean into my curiosity and ask questions to try to better understand the situation. _Why this person do that behavior? Do they think that's ok?_ By quickly reframing the conversation from, "This person did something bad" to, "This person is offering me information I don't have that can help me be more effective," I've been able to shift from frustration to gratitude. I try to respond by saying, "Thank you for trusting me enough to share that."

Managers are responsible for optimizing the machine (their team)--not just on any given hour or day, but consistently, over the long-term. Salaried engineers are not paid per hour in their seat because not all hours are equal. They're paid for the value they provide, and that value inevitably varies week to week. For a great employee, leaving early one day or being unproductive another comes out in the wash. There would certainly be future project deadlines that required the occasional late night--_there were, and when the time came, this person delivered_.

To my surprise, this was hardly the only example or even the only person who surprised me with such blunt feedback. Over the coming years, I sat through many similar (though less extreme) conversations where my reports volunteered similar feedback about mistakes they made and policies or values they violated, and I often found myself questioning whether I was right not to react in the moment. _I would never dream of telling my boss I didn't do any work last week. My boss would never tolerate that behavior. I shouldn't tolerate it either._ But I kept returning to the same internal question and conclusion: _Would I rather know or not know? The best way to optimize for knowing is to not punish their honesty._

The key point here is NOT to ignore or overlook bad behavior. It's to decouple giving the necessary corrective feedback or behavior modification from the point of receiving the other person's honest feedback. It's not either-or--it's both. But they don't have to take place in the same moment. When the other person is speaking, your job is to [listen to understand, not to respond](/principles/listen-to-understand). By not punishing their honesty, you can validate and strengthen the other person's trust so they will come to you again in the future. This lets you instead focus on gathering new information that will help you better understand reality and improve your ability to succeed in improving future behavior. It's also consistent with being a [continuous learning environment](/principles/continuous-learning) where past failures are learning opportunities rather than punishment opportunities. Remember, **the objective is to minimize future bad behavior--not to punish past bad behavior.**
