# Doing what you’re good at hurts the team.

> "Doing what you’re good at hurts the team." - Peldi Guilizzoni

<!-- Be careful not to create an environment where others are dependent on you to do certain things. If you leave or take time off, your team will be stuck without you. It will also keep you from being able to take on more responsibility until your team is able to operate successfully in your absence.

Rather than doing the things you're good at, focus on teaching others to be good at the things you're good at. -->
