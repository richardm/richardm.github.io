# Deliver incrementally and iterate

> **_If you wait to ship until something is perfect, youâ€™ve waited too long._** --Unknown

**Ship as soon as the value you deliver exceeds the pain of using it.**

## Features within an MVP cannot be prioritized

If you have defined the true Minimum Viable Product (MVP), then the scope is so narrow that all of it is needed to go live, and therefore all of its features are equal in priority since you cannot release until all of it is complete. If you are prioritizing features in an MVP, stop prioritizing and start reducing scope. Focus on shipping the most minimal MVP possible where the value you deliver exceeds the pain of using what you provide. If you wait to ship until something is perfect, you've waited too long.
