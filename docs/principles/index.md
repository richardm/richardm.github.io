# My Leadership Principles

Most ideas are derivative, including these. Share them freely.

> ==“The most important thing is that you develop your own principles and ideally write them down, especially if you are working with others.”== - Ray Dalio

I started writing down my personal guiding principles in 2021 after reading [Principles by Ray Dalio](https://www.principles.com/principles/418eaeca-564f-41e8-bd90-8e0d042f28d5/#table-of-contents). I've accumulated most of this from reading over the years. Over time, I will try to identify and cite sources.

> **Work In Progress**: Please note this is a rough draft. As a perfectionist, I would prefer to keep it private until perfect, but [done is better than perfect](/docs/principles/done-is-better-than-perfect.md).

Principles should be tested and refined. If you have feedback, disagreement, or suggestions, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/richardm/richardm.github.io/issues). If you take the time to read this, I value your feedback and perspective.

## Principles for Operating an Effective Engineering Team

- **Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.** Unless it's a matter of life or death, take the time to invest in your CI/CD and test automation.
- **Hold people accountable.** It’s not kind to your top performers to fail to reward them while failing to discipline your bottom performers. See: [Be kind, not nice.](/docs/principles/be-kind-not-nice.md)
- **Create organizations where people progress by merit**, not luck or privilege.
- **High performers love accountability.** They want to be recognized and rewarded for their efforts, and they want to be continually improving. The best way to hire and retain the best people is to hold everyone accountable. A sure-fire way to lose your top performers to disengagement or attrition is to fail to hold everyone accountable.
- **Recognize that disengagement is the same as attrition;** it only differs in intensity.

## Principles for Managing People Effectively

- **Be the boss you wish you had.**
- **“Doing what you’re good at hurts the team.”** - Peldi Guilizzoni via [The most counterintuitive leadership tip? Leaders, stop doing what you're good at.](https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/12/18/the-most-counterintuitive-leadership-tip-leaders-stop-doing-what-youre-good-at/)

> **“Great leaders are not responsible for the job. They’re responsible for the people who are responsible for the job.”** - Simon Sinek

> “At some point, you’ll get promoted to the position where we’re now responsible for the people who do the job we used to do, but nobody shows us how to do that. And that’s why we get managers and not leaders. Because the reason that managers are micromanaging us is that they actually do know how to do the job better than us. That’s what got them promoted. We have to go through this transition of being responsible for the job and then turning into somebody who’s now responsible for the people who are responsible for the job. One of the great things that is lacking in most of our companies is they are not teaching us how to lead.” - Simon Sinek

- **Trust is your most important asset.** It can only be earned, and it can be lost quickly.
- To be trusted, all you have to do is consistently do what you say you’re going to do. (See: Bringing out Best in People)
- **Never sacrifice your integrity.** People will quickly forget what you accomplished, but they won’t forget how you behaved.
- [**Be kind, not nice.**](/docs/principles/be-kind-not-nice.md) Ruinous empathy is nice but it’s not kind. It’s not kind to the person to withhold the constructive criticism they need most. It’s also not kind to deliver it poorly.
- Few things destroy morale faster than failing to recognize your top achievers.
- **Become comfortable with conflict.** Especially if you're naturally an agreeable person.
- **Everyone’s behavior makes sense to them.**
- **A company is _always_ designed to produce the results it produces.** e.g. If there are lots of bugs, the behaviors that lead to that are being reinforced. (See: Bringing out the Best in People - Book Summary)
- Managers are responsible for identifying the behaviors that lead to good and bad results and arranging for the consequences that are necessary and sufficient to accomplish the company’s objectives. (See: Bringing out the Best in People - Book Summary)
- The role of leaders in every organization is not to find fault or place blame but to analyze why people are behaving as they are and modify the consequences to promote the behavior they need. (See: Bringing out the Best in People - Book Summary)

## Principles for Hiring Engineers

- Hire people who demonstrate initiative and eagerness to learn.
- Hire people who are **Hungry, Humble, and Emotionally Intelligent** (See: The Ideal Team Player)
- **Hire for strengths, not for lack of weaknesses.** (See: Gallup CliftonStrengths)
- **Hire people who put the team above themselves.**
- **Practice disconfirmation.** Whether you want to hire someone or pass, look for evidence that you're wrong.
- **Only hire people who bring up the average for their role and level.**
- Trust your gut. If your gut says not to make a hire, try to figure out why. You may make a few mistakes learning to trust your gut, but it’s important to develop this ability. -> Learn when to trust your gut and when not to trust your gut (aka instinct, intuition). Develop a curiosity about your intuition. If you have a strong intuition, learn to reduce it to writing so you can test it in different scenarios and share it with others. Formalize your thinking to give others the benefit of your insights.
- **Hire for skills that are not easily taught.**
- Hire people who are focused on their team’s success.

> “People can change, but the best predictor of future actions is someone’s past actions.” - John Kotter

## Principles for Building Effective Teams

- **If you have a premium team, pay for premium tools** Don't make the mistake of spending dollars in labor to save pennies in tools. (See: Scarcity mindset.)
- Building great teams at work is about assembling the right combination of people and skills, much like sports teams are comprised of different roles.
- **Pair people with complementary skills.** Understand that people have different strengths and that the whole can be more than the sum of the parts; shore up weaknesses, but don’t try to make everyone be the same.
- **Pair action-oriented people with methodical people to get the best of both.** Be careful to do this effectively or it will just frustrate both people.
- **Agreeable, conscientious people are easy to manage.** They are intrinsically motivated and eager to please others. They will do more than their fair share of the work. Value them and protect them, and they will stay with you for the long haul. Be careful not to let these people be taken advantage of by their more demanding counterparts. Don’t let them burn themselves out.
- **Disagreeable people challenge the organization to improve.** You need some of these people to get better as an organization. A team full of only agreeable people won’t improve as fast as a team with a couple of disagreeable people. But as a manager, you cannot let the disagreeable people run over the agreeable people.
- Hire some assertive people. **Assertive people move things forward.** They’re decisive when the team is spinning in circles. But some people are unaware they’re being aggressive rather than assertive. **Assertive people say what needs to be said.** And they're often willing to say it when others are not. Good assertiveness looks like Being Bold. Bad assertiveness looks like being un-Inclusive.
- **Recognize the difference between assertive vs aggressive.**
- **Teams are the minimum unit of delivery.** Not the individual. Teams—not individuals—are responsible for delivering features. Teams—not individuals—are responsible for quality. Estimates should be based on the team’s capacity, not an individual’s capacity.
- **Avoid single points of failure.** This applies to people as well as systems.
- Every line of code should have a clear owner; code that is owned by everyone is not owned by anyone. Code should only be owned by teams, not individuals.

## Principles for Getting Things Done

- [**Done is better than perfect.**](/docs/principles/done-is-better-than-perfect.md) "Perfectionists sacrifice the progress that matters most for improvement at the margin." -- Unknown
- **“As a leader, your job is to flip the highest order bit.”** —Unknown
- “Doing the correct thing poorly is worth more than executing the wrong things perfectly.” -Unknown. (From [David Fallarme on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dfallarme_it-was-the-weirdest-thing-my-ceo-ever-told-activity-7039610791863427075-PqP5/))
- **Discipline beats motivation.** You can’t rely on motivation; discipline will transform your dreams into reality.
- **Eat the Frog.** Prioritize your must-dos above all of your like to dos
- **Weigh the value of additional information against the cost of delaying**
- **Good execution matters more than good ideas.**

## Principles for Success

- Knowing when not to bet is as important as knowing what bets to make
- Remember the Pareto Principle (the 80-20 rule) and identify the 20%
- **Fall in love with the problem, not the solution**
- **Fall in love with the journey, not the destination**
- **Live in the present.** The past is a memory, and the future is a fantasy. You can only act in the present, so be present.
- **Cultivate an abundance mindset.** A scarcity mindset is a trauma response that optimizes for conservation rather than growth.
- **Get to the point you can prioritize growth over conservation.** A scarcity mindset is a trauma response that forces you to conserve rather than to grow. Cultivate an abundance mindset focused on becoming all you can be.
- Surround yourself with people who are continually learning.
- Understand the impact of compounding and invest early in things that compound. It doesn’t matter so much how much a person knows today as long as they are continuously learning.

## Principles for Writing

- **Writing forces you to clarify your thoughts.**
- **Effective teams document their core values, principles, and processes so they are widely understood and refined**
- Share your ideas early, get feedback, and iterate.
- Seek input from people who are smarter than you, dumber than you, and have different perspectives.
- Ideas should be shared freely so they can be improved; execution is your competitive advantage.

## Who to work with and where to work

- **Most adult learning occurs on the job.** Look for a job that uses the skills you want to develop, and look for a company that’s great at the skill you want to develop. What to become a good manager? Work at a place with great managers. Want to be a great investor? Work at a place with great investors. Want to become a great software engineer? Etc…
- Life is short, and we spend most of it at work.
- You become like the people you associate with most closely. Many of these people are coworkers. Choose those people carefully.
- Prioritize working with good people.
- Don’t work for jerks. Don’t work with jerks. Don’t hire jerks. (Remember, [people are not their behavior](/docs/principles/people-are-not-their-behaviors). Do I need to refine this principle? Since this is a draft, I consider a “jerk” someone who repeatedly and consistently demonstrates a pattern of jerk-like behavior and disregard for others.)
- If you are a high achiever, seek to work in a place that values accountability.

## On Delegating

- ~~**Leadership is not doing the work; leadership is supporting the people who do the work.**~~ A better version of this is under Engineering Management. Move it here?
- Leadership is not making all of the decisions. Leadership is sharing all the relevant information and building your team so they can make the best decision.
- **Don’t push information up to those with the authority; push authority down to those with the information.**
- **Delegate as much as possible** within the constraints of meeting your deliverables.
- **Doing what you’re best at hurts the team.** Teach them how to do it. (See: Leadership is not doing the work; leadership is supporting the people who do the work.)
- **Hire the best people possible and get out of their way.**

## On Communication

- **Leadership is communication.** Communicate a vision. Communicate needs. Communicate challenges. Communicate principles. Communicate expectations.
- The more important the information, the more it must be repeated. Say it different ways, in different contexts, and in different mediums.
- Culture are the shared values that determine how we operate. Model those values consistently and demand no less from others in leadership.
- It’s _usually_ better to communicate the key point inelegantly than to delay the message until you can polish it. But know when that’s not the case. (See: Done is better than perfect.)
- Communicate what you’re going to do before you do it--with your boss so they are in the loop and can sign off, and with your team, so they can provide feedback.

## On Disagreement

- **Embrace constructive disagreement.** There’s little to be learned when everyone agrees. Hire the smartest people you can find, assemble diverse perspectives, and look for areas of disagreement. This is where the magic happens. This is where new solutions are born. This is where competitive advantage can be extracted.
- **Learn how to disagree without being disagreeable.**
- **Never debate someone when you're right.** In a debate, both sides are dug in, defending their existing views and are unlikely to learn efficiently. In a conversation, both sides are seeking to understand what they’re missing. Don’t debate close-minded people. It’s not worth the effort, and open-minded people won’t make you.
- **Recognize the difference between being assertive and being aggressive.**
- **Assume good intentions**

## Other Uncategorized Thoughts

- Avoid righteous indignation and embrace humility and curiosity. Note: These can be learned. Also, see The Righteous Mind.
- **It’s not enough to know what works, you need to know why.**
- Recognize the things in your circle of influence vs circle of concern

> **Common sense ideas just mean ideas that haven’t been challenged or proven to be true. They’re the unreflective opinions of ordinary people.** Should leaders be unreflective? Of course not. When you ask someone to use “common sense” what you really mean is do what I would have done if you had the same experience and perspective as I do — which of course no one else does. Everyone always does what makes sense given their experience. That doesn’t remotely make it the right thing to do. Common sense accepts the obvious. Science questions the obvious. Common sense says of course. Science asks but why? Common sense is vague, scientific knowledge is precise. Common sense is not consistent, scientific knowledge is. Common sense is gained through uncontrolled experience, scientific knowledge through controlled experiments. Keeping good records is the best way to learn from your successes and failures. Not knowing why things get better or worse is a problem. If it gets better for no reason later it will get worse for no reason. And you won’t know why. You won’t know how to reproduce the good results or prevent the bad. It’s not enough to know what works, you need to know why.

## Other Principles

Other sources of inspiration for operating principles include:

- [37signals](https://37signals.com/)
- [The GitLab Handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/)

Rather than reinvent the wheel, here are links to some external principles that resonate with me:

- [37signals — 05. Err on the side of do](https://37signals.com/05/) I am not naturally good at this but have come to agree with this over time.
- [37signals — 19. Pay people, not addresses](https://37signals.com/19/). I agree with this in part. If you want to build a high achieving team, hire and pay people based on the value they provide, not the zip code where they live.
- [37signals — 12. Hours aren’t equal](https://37signals.com/12/)
- [37signals — 13. On repeat](https://37signals.com/13/) This doesn’t just apply to new ideas. It applies to all important ideas.
- [37signals — 14. Meetings aren’t free](https://37signals.com/14/)
- [37signals — 16. The trap of marginal thinking](https://37signals.com/16/) Whenever possible, buy, don’t build.
- [37signals — 21. Know no](https://37signals.com/21/)
- [37signals — 25. Disagree and commit](https://37signals.com/25/)
- [37signals — 28. Shots on goals](https://37signals.com/28/)
- [37signals — 30. Miscommunication problems](https://37signals.com/30/)
- [37signals — 31. Easy?](https://37signals.com/31/)
- [37signals — 33. Planning is guessing](https://37signals.com/33/) SAY IT LOUDER.
- [37signals — 34. Sleep on it](https://37signals.com/34/) Never make a big life decision without sleeping on it.
- [37signals — 35. Companies aren’t families](https://37signals.com/35/) Companies aren’t families, but great teams are. Many people spend more time with their coworkers than anyone else, including their immediate family. After spending 10 years at one company, I believe that great teams have all the good and bad that comes with family dynamics. You have the authority figures. You have the teenagers who grow into adults and learn to navigate larger roles. You have the crazy uncles with their hare-brained ideas, the kind, supportive grandparents, and the nurturing parent figures. You disagree. You get your feelings hurt. You part ways at times. And like family, good teams find a way to support each other, provide mutual value, work through conflict, and keep the relationship working over the long term. And like all families, sometimes the bittersweet time comes for someone to move away or to go out on their own.

### Principles from GitLab Handbook

[Kindness | GitLab Values | The GitLab Handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#kindness)

Values from the GitLab Handbook:

- We value caring for others. Demonstrating we care for people provides an effective framework for challenging directly and delivering feedback. We disagree with companies that say [Evaluate People Accurately, Not “Kindly”](https://inside.bwater.com/publications/principles_excerpt) . We’re all for accurate assessment, but we think it must be done in a kind way. Give as much positive feedback as you can, and do it in a public way. - GitLab Handbook (Values: Kindness)

> I disagree with this dichotomy. People should be evaluated accurately. The most kind feedback is the honest feedback that helps the recipient. Be aware of other circumstances. Don't overwhelm the person when they're struggling.

- **Everyone can remind anyone in the company about our values.** If there is a disagreement about the interpretations, the discussion can be escalated to more people within the company without repercussions.
- Share problems you run into, ask for help, be forthcoming with information and **speak up**.
- All of this. [Give Feedback Effectively | GitLab Values](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#give-feedback-effectively)
- “Give negative feedback in the smallest setting possible. One-on-one video calls are preferred.” “Negative feedback can be given in a group setting if it’s to someone higher in the management chain. This shows that no one is above feedback.” ([Negative Feedback is 1x1 | GitLab Values](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#negative-feedback-is-1-1)). Having been on the receiving end of this, I agree almost entirely with the spirit of this; however, truly egregious behavior, especially by those in higher profile roles, should be called out in the forum where it took place to model for everyone that it is not tolerated.
- If you have to remind someone of the position you have in the company, you’re doing something wrong. People already know [our decision-making process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/#making-decisions). Explain why you’re making the decision, and respect everyone irrespective of their function. This includes using the rank of another person - [including the CEO](https://twitter.com/EmiliejayG/status/1198731054162432000) - to sell an idea or decision.

> While I agree with this, I’ve been surprised to encounter people who don’t understand who’s responsible for making various decisions or who think they have more authority than they do. Usually this is due to a communication failure by leadership. In these cases, it’s sometimes necessary to reiterate your role. (Also, don’t be the one who makes someone else have to do that!)

**Address behavior, but don’t label people**

> There is a lot of good in [this article](http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/10/the_no_asshole_.html) about not wanting jerks on our team, but ==we believe that **jerk** is a label for behavior rather than an inherent classification of a person. We avoid classifications.==
> [Address behavior, but don’t label people | GitLab Values | The GitLab Handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#address-behavior-but-dont-label-people)

I wholeheartedly agree with this. While part of a manager’s job is to change bad behavior over time, I maintain that it’s not worth the effort when it comes to people who have a severe lack of emotional intelligence, are extremely negative, and show little desire to improve. The amount of time and energy required is better spent elsewhere.

**Say sorry**

> If you made a mistake, apologize as soon as possible. ==Saying sorry is not a sign of weakness but one of strength. The people that do the most work will likely make the most mistakes.==
>
> [GitLab Values | The GitLab Handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#say-sorry)

> “In many organizations, there’s a subtle, low-level, persistent pressure to continually prove your worth. And I believe that this fuels imposter syndrome and wreaks havoc on [mental health](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/mental-health/) .” - Darren M.

**Don’t let each other fail**

> Keep an eye out for others who may be struggling or stuck. If you see someone who needs help, reach out and assist, or connect them with someone else who can provide expertise or assistance. We succeed and shine together!
> [GitLab Values | The GitLab Handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#dont-let-each-other-fail)

> The best teams don’t say they’re “flat”—they become that way culturally because the people who make up the team feel invested in the company. They feel willing to own problems and decisions and to speak up regardless of rank or hierarchy. When people at every level feel this way, they are more willing to take risks, push the limit, try new projects, and not wait to get things done.
>
> [How a Founder’s Mentality Encourages Employee Recognition](https://conscious.org/how-a-founders-mentality-encourages-employee-recognition/)

**Good employee recognition is specific and timely.**

> Don’t wait to make someone feel recognized for something great they accomplished. In other words: ==Send a short note instead of waiting to edit a long one.== As in product development, employee recognition can happen in sprints. Move fast and praise quickly.
>
> [How a Founder’s Mentality Encourages Employee Recognition](https://conscious.org/how-a-founders-mentality-encourages-employee-recognition/)

> Founders fail. They fail _all the time_. ==And employees need to feel empowered and even recognized for big risks that don’t work out in addition to big wins that do.== Part of being a Conscious Company means accepting that failure is necessary for success; that’s why our operating value of Be 20% Wrong, Chase 10x is important. Because if you’re never wrong, you’re doing it wrong.
>
> [How a Founder’s Mentality Encourages Employee Recognition](https://conscious.org/how-a-founders-mentality-encourages-employee-recognition/)

**Blameless problem solving**

> Investigate mistakes in a way that focuses on the situational aspects of a failure’s mechanism and the decision-making process that led to the failure, rather than cast blame on a person or team. We hold blameless [root cause analyses](https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/) and [retrospectives](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/management/group-retrospectives/) for stakeholders to speak up without fear of punishment or retribution.

# Engineering Best Practices

## On Improving Stability & Quality

- Require all code changes to meet minimum quality controls before going into the main/master branch.
- Gate code changes on passing test suites.

## On Automated Testing

- **Prioritize the stability of your test suite over the quantity of tests.** A failing test suite should be a critical or blocker level priority for at least one team. Flaky tests introduce noise and undermine trust.
- **Require BDD tests for critical-path user stories.**
- The point of manual QA is to catch bugs before they reach customers, and the point of automated test is to catch bugs before they reach manual QA.
- **_Everyone_ is responsible for quality.**
- **_Developers_--not QA--are responsible for writing code that works.**
- **Write tests at the lowest layer possible**: unit tests, then integration tests, then e2e/API tests. Recognize that BDD tests can be written in any layer, but most of them will live in higher layers (e.g. e2e). This is more important than the pyramid vs trophy debate, but IMO leads to a pyramid shape.
- Static analysis and compile time eliminates a whole class of runtime bugs and unit tests.
- Unit tests are highest ROI at preventing regressions because they're cheapest to write and maintain and execute fastest, but they are limited in scope and won't prevent most regressions.
- The point of integration tests is to catch bugs before e2e tests. The point of unit tests is to catch bugs before integration tests.
- If you can't reliably ship without introducing regressions, prioritize writing e2e tests for your critical path.
- **Make deployments a non-event.** Automate them. Make them frequent. Rely on automated tests (including performance tests) to inform the team of regressions. It's generally less risky to ship one change than many.
