# Leadership Principles

> Never doubt the capacity of the people you lead to accomplish whatever you dream for them. Martin Luther King, Jr. didn’t say, "I have a dream, and I hope you’ll be up for it." - Benjamin Zander

> “As leaders, we’re giving out grades in every encounter we have with people. We can choose to give out grades as an _expectation to live up to_... or we can offer grades as a _possibility to live into_. The second approach is much more powerful.” - Benjamin Zander

## Principles for Operating an Effective Engineering Team

- [**Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.**](/principles/slow-is-smooth-and-smooth-is-fast) Unless it's a matter of life or death, take the time to invest in your CI/CD and test automation.
- **Hold people accountable.** It’s not kind to your top performers to fail to reward them while failing to discipline your bottom performers. See: [Be kind, not nice.](/principles/be-kind-not-nice)
- [**Create a meritocracy**](/principles/meritocracy)
- **High performers love accountability.** They want to be recognized and rewarded for their efforts, and they want to be continually improving. The best way to hire and retain the best people is to hold everyone accountable. A sure-fire way to lose your top performers to disengagement or attrition is to fail to hold everyone accountable.

## Principles for Managing People Effectively

- **Be the boss you wish you had.**
- **“Doing what you’re good at hurts the team.”** - Peldi Guilizzoni via [The most counterintuitive leadership tip? Leaders, stop doing what you're good at.](https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/12/18/the-most-counterintuitive-leadership-tip-leaders-stop-doing-what-youre-good-at/){:target="\_blank"}
  > "Don't take learning opportunities away from other people." - Tanya Reilly. Put under (Doing What you're best at hurts the team)
- **[Leadership is not doing the work; leadership is supporting the people who do the work.](/principles/leadership-is-not-doing)**
- [Surround yourself with smart people who disagree with you.](/principles/smart-people-who-disagree) - Move this under leadership?
- [**Trust is your most important asset.**](/principles/earn-trust) It can only be earned, and it can be lost quickly. Earn it before you need it.
  **Focus on maximizing employee engagement.** Recognize that quitting is just an extreme form of disengagement. Focus on improving engagement.
- **Recognize that disengagement is the same as attrition;** it differs only in intensity.
- **Never sacrifice your integrity.** People will quickly forget what you accomplished, but they won’t forget how you behaved.
- [**Be kind, not nice.**](/principles/be-kind-not-nice) Ruinous empathy is nice but it’s not kind. It’s not kind to the person to withhold the constructive criticism they need most. It’s also not kind to deliver it poorly.
- Few things destroy morale faster than failing to recognize your top achievers.
- **Become comfortable with conflict.** Especially if you're naturally an agreeable person.
- **Everyone’s behavior makes sense to them.**
- **A company is _always_ designed to produce the results it produces.** e.g. If there are lots of bugs, the behaviors that lead to that are being reinforced. ([Bringing Out the Best in People](/summaries/bringing-out-the-best-in-people))

> "Managers are responsible for identifying the behaviors that lead to good and bad results and arranging for the consequences that are necessary and sufficient to accomplish the company’s objectives." - Aubrey Daniels ([Bringing Out the Best in People](/summaries/bringing-out-the-best-in-people))

> "The role of leaders in every organization is not to find fault or place blame but to analyze why people are behaving as they are and modify the consequences to promote the behavior they need." - Aubrey Daniels ([Bringing Out the Best in People](/summaries/bringing-out-the-best-in-people))

> "As the manager, it's your role to ensure that all the interpersonal dynamics at play within your sphere of influence are healthy and productive." - John Barton

- **Never punish honesty.**

> "Finding fault with people for their behavior is unproductive and unfair. They are simply behaving in a manner consistent with the consequences they’re receiving now and have received in the past." - Aubrey Daniels ([Bringing Out the Best in People](/summaries/bringing-out-the-best-in-people))

> "The role of leaders in every organization is not to find fault or place blame but to analyze why people are behaving as they are and modify the consequences to promote the behavior they need." - Aubrey Daniels ([Bringing Out the Best in People](/summaries/bringing-out-the-best-in-people))

## Principles for Hiring Engineers

> “Look for people who have lots of great questions. Smart people are the ones who ask the most thoughtful questions, as opposed to thinking they have all the answers. Great questions are a much better indicator of future success than great answers.” - Ray Dalio

- Hire people who demonstrate initiative and eagerness to learn.
- Hire people who are **Hungry, Humble, and Emotionally Intelligent** (See: The Ideal Team Player)
- **Hire for strengths, not for lack of weaknesses.** (See: Gallup CliftonStrengths [How to create a strengths-based company culture](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/290903/how-to-create-strengths-based-company-culture.aspx){:target="\_blank"})
- **Hire people who put the team's success above their individual success.**
- **Practice disconfirmation.** Whether you want to hire someone or pass, look for evidence that you're wrong.
- **Only hire people who bring up the average for their role and level.**
- **Hire for skills that are not easily taught.** If someone has demonstrated they can master one programming framework, it is likely they can master another. Unless you truly need an expert in that framework, it should not be a reason to disqualify them.
- **Past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior.**
  > “People can change, but the best predictor of future actions is someone’s past actions.” - John Kotter

## Principles for Building Effective Teams

- **If you have a premium team, pay for premium tools.** Don't make the mistake of spending dollars in labor to save pennies in tools. (See: Scarcity mindset.)
- Building great teams at work is about assembling the right combination of people and skills, much like sports teams are comprised of different roles.
- **Pair people with complementary skills.** Understand that people have different strengths and that the whole can be more than the sum of the parts; shore up weaknesses, but don’t try to make everyone be the same. Instead, build teams by combining people with different strengths.
- **Pair action-oriented people with methodical people to get the best of both.** Be careful to do this effectively or it will just frustrate both people.
- **Agreeable, conscientious people are easy to manage.** They are intrinsically motivated and eager to please others. They will do more than their fair share of the work. Value them and protect them, and they will stay with you for the long haul. Be careful not to let these people be taken advantage of by their more demanding counterparts. Don’t let them burn themselves out.
- **Disagreeable people challenge the organization to improve.** You need some of these people to get better as an organization. A team full of only agreeable people won’t improve as fast as a team with a couple of disagreeable people. But as a manager, you cannot let the disagreeable people run over the agreeable people.
  **Quotes:**
  > "If you and your partner always agree, one of you is unnecessary." -- Unknown
- Hire some assertive people. **Assertive people move things forward.** They’re decisive when the team is spinning in circles. But some people are unaware they’re being aggressive rather than assertive. **Assertive people say what needs to be said.** And they're often willing to say it when others are not. Good assertiveness looks like Being Bold. Bad assertiveness looks like being un-Inclusive.
- **Recognize the difference between assertive vs aggressive.** Assertive people challenge the team to improve; aggressive people sacrifice others to advance their goals.
- **Teams are the minimum unit of delivery.** Not the individual. Teams—not individuals—are responsible for delivering features. Teams—not individuals—are responsible for quality. Estimates should be based on the team’s capacity, not an individual’s capacity.
- **Avoid single points of failure.** This applies to people as well as systems. The magic number is three. That way, when the primary goes out, you still have redundancy. The worst time to train a backup is when the new primary is already overwhelmed with their new responsibilities. Train your backup's backup before you need them.
- Every line of code should have a clear owner; code that is owned by everyone is not owned by anyone. Code should only be owned by teams, not individuals.

## Principles for Getting Things Done

- [**Done is better than perfect.**](/principles/done-is-better-than-perfect) "Perfectionists sacrifice the progress that matters most for improvement at the margin." -- Unknown
- **“As a leader, your job is to flip the highest order bit.”** —Unknown
- “Doing the correct thing poorly is worth more than executing the wrong things perfectly.” -Unknown. (From [David Fallarme on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dfallarme_it-was-the-weirdest-thing-my-ceo-ever-told-activity-7039610791863427075-PqP5/){:target="\_blank"})
- **Discipline beats motivation.** You can’t rely on motivation; discipline will transform your dreams into reality.
- **Eat the Frog.** Prioritize your must-dos above all of your like-to-dos
- **Weigh the value of additional information against the cost of delaying**
- ~~**Good execution matters more than good ideas.**~~ _Note: This is inconsistent with "Done is better than perfect", and I think this version is wrong. A good idea executed poorly is better than a bad idea executed perfectly. What I meant to say here is that without execution, a good idea has little utility._

> "A goal without without an active project is a dream." - Tiago Forte

> "A project without a goal is a hobby." - Tiago Forte

## Culture

- [You can’t delegate culture](/principles/you-cant-delegate-culture)

> "The standard you ignore is the standard you accept." - David Morrison (paraphrased)

- Generally, praise in public and criticize in private.
- **Criticize egregious behavior in public.** Being seen to tolerate bad behavior can give the impression that behavior is ok.

## Compensation

- Create a meritocracy.
- Pay people at the top of their personal market (the [Netflix](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture){:target="\_blank"} approach). See [Create a meritocracy](/principles/meritocracy)
- Pay people not addresses.
- Pay people for the value they provide, not their cost of living or the cost of labor in their market
- Don't stack rank your people if you want them to truly put their teammates first. See [Align incentives](/principles/align-incentives).

## People & Relationships

- **Everyone’s behavior makes sense to them.** See: [Bringing Out the Best in People](/summaries/bringing-out-the-best-in-people)

> “When you have great relationships, any process works. When you don’t, no process works.” - Will Larson (See: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.)

## Decision Making

- **Don’t push information up to those with the authority; push authority down to those with the information.**
- [Your role as the leader is to encourage your people to think for themselves — not to enact a set of rules for them.](https://hbr.org/2023/03/5-strategies-to-empower-employees-to-make-decisions){:target="\_blank"}
- **Decisions we make today tend to stick around and impact us for quite a long time.** People tend to continue doing what they’re doing simply because they’re doing it, and it takes a lot of force to change the way people do things.
- When there are no good options, choose the least bad option.
- In groups, make it clear who gets to make the decision. It can be the manager, or it can be delegated to someone on the team.
- People reason with their minds but make decisions with their gut. Learn to trust your gut by making decisions with it and learning from them. Next time you’re faced with the same question, you’ll know whether you can trust it again and what you learned from the last time. It's ok to make bad decisions as long as you learn from them. Ideally, you want to make them when the stakes are low.
- Recognize that even if you are "in charge," you may not be the person who is best equipped to make the decision.
- Don't overlook the cost of indecision. Sometimes failing to act is acting, and failing to decide is deciding.
- Analysis paralysis is an obsession with making the best decision. Recognize that you cannot go through life only making optimal decisions, and you’ll burn yourself out if you try.
- Action creates clarity. Rather than trying to see 10 steps ahead, focus on taking step one and then looking for step two.
- If you go to the effort to make a decision, be sure to write it down.
- People are indecisive because they’re scared of making a mistake.

## Diversity & Inclusion

> "If you're under-represented, getting promoted is diversity work. Being visibly successful is the most powerful diversity work she can do. She can be the representation someone needs. She can be in a much better position for mentorship and sponsorship." - Tanya Reilly

## Principles for Writing

- **Writing forces you to clarify your thoughts.** Writing exposes the weaknesses in your arguments. If you can't articulate your ideas, you don't fully understand them.
- **Effective teams document their core values, principles, and processes so they are widely understood and refined**
- Share your ideas early, get feedback, and iterate. See [Just start](/principles/just-start).
- Seek input from people who are smarter than you, dumber than you, and have different perspectives.
- Ideas should be shared freely so they can be improved; execution is your competitive advantage.

> "The most important thing you can do with an idea: get it out of your head." - Jack Dorsey

## On Delegating

- **Delegate as much as possible** within the constraints of meeting your deliverables.
- **Doing what you’re best at hurts the team.** Teach them how to do it. (See: [Leadership is not doing](/principles/leadership-is-not-doing))
- **Hire the best people possible and get out of their way.**

## On Communication

- **Leadership is communication.** Communicate a vision. Communicate needs. Communicate challenges. Communicate principles. Communicate expectations.
- The more important the information, the more it must be repeated. Say it different ways, in different contexts, and in different mediums.
- Culture are the shared values that determine how we operate. Model those values consistently and demand no less from others in leadership.
- It’s _usually_ better to communicate the key point inelegantly than to delay the message until you can polish it. But know when that’s not the case. (See: Done is better than perfect.)
- Communicate what you’re going to do before you do it--with your boss so they are in the loop and can sign off, and with your team, so they can provide feedback.

## On Disagreement

- **Embrace constructive disagreement.** There’s little to be learned when everyone agrees. Hire the smartest people you can find, assemble diverse perspectives, and look for areas of disagreement. This is where the magic happens. This is where new solutions are born. This is where competitive advantage can be extracted.
- **Learn how to disagree without being disagreeable.**
- **Never debate someone when you're right.** In a debate, both sides are dug in, defending their existing views and are unlikely to learn efficiently. In a conversation, both sides are seeking to understand what they’re missing. Don’t debate close-minded people. It’s not worth the effort, and open-minded people won’t make you.
- **Recognize the difference between being assertive and being aggressive.**
- **Assume good intentions**

## On Boldness

- Leadership requires courage.

> “Courage is the main quality of leadership.” - Walt Disney

> “All successful people have some combination of three traits: being naive enough to walk into a hard thing without realizing how hard it is (or else they would never try), being conscientious enough to not quit when they realize just how hard it is, and the intelligence to eventually figure it out in time.” - Engineering Director at Google

> “It’s the strong swimmers who drown.”

## On Reading

TODO: Move reading-related quotes to the Book Summaries intro:

> “My policy [is] reading every annual report in sight that can further my knowledge _about anything._” -Warren Buffett

> “I read and read and read. I probably read _5 to 6 hours per day_. I read five _daily newspapers_, I read a fair number of _magazines_, I read _10k’s_, I read _annual reports_, and I read a lot of other things too. I’ve always enjoyed reading. I love reading biographies for example.” – [Warren Buffett](http://mastersinvest.com/reading-quotes){:target="\_blank"}

## Making Decisions

- **Always sleep on it before making a large decision.** Emotions can be manipulated. Don’t let yourself get carried away. If it’s the right decision, it will still be the right decision tomorrow. You may be less excited, but you’ll be more sure.
- Ask yourself: "Is the Best Case scenario worth risking the worst case scenario?"
-

## Other Uncategorized Thoughts

- Avoid righteous indignation and embrace humility and curiosity. Note: These can be learned. Also, see The Righteous Mind.
- **It’s not enough to know what works, you need to know why.**
- Recognize the things in your circle of influence vs circle of concern

> **Common sense ideas just mean ideas that haven’t been challenged or proven to be true. They’re the unreflective opinions of ordinary people.** Should leaders be unreflective? Of course not. When you ask someone to use “common sense” what you really mean is do what I would have done if you had the same experience and perspective as I do — which of course no one else does. Everyone always does what makes sense given their experience. That doesn’t remotely make it the right thing to do. Common sense accepts the obvious. Science questions the obvious. Common sense says of course. Science asks but why? Common sense is vague, scientific knowledge is precise. Common sense is not consistent, scientific knowledge is. Common sense is gained through uncontrolled experience, scientific knowledge through controlled experiments. Keeping good records is the best way to learn from your successes and failures. Not knowing why things get better or worse is a problem. If it gets better for no reason later it will get worse for no reason. And you won’t know why. You won’t know how to reproduce the good results or prevent the bad. It’s not enough to know what works, you need to know why. - [Bringing Out the Best in People](/summaries/bringing-out-the-best-in-people)

> "The purpose of negotiation is not always to reach agreement... The purpose of negotiation is to explore whether you can satisfy your interests better through an agreement than you could by pursuing your Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA). Your BATNA is your walkaway alternative. It’s your best course of action for satisfying your interests without the other’s agreement." - William Ury (?)

- Create orgs that mimic the architecture you want the machine to exhibit. - James Lewis (Thoughtworks): Inverse Conway Maneuver

> "The vast majority of our learning happens on the job." - Tanya Reilly
> "Virtuous cycles" -- this is the word I was looking for with the correlation stuff.

- Principle: You only get better when you invest effort.

  > "I'm good at everything I put effort into." - Polina Giralt.

- **Trust your gut, and look for bias.** Your instincts are based in your experiences, and experienced people have highly refined instincts. Learn when to trust your gut and when not to. Deveop a curiosity about why you have strong instincts. Critique your instincts. Look for bias. Don't follow it blindly. By doing so, your intuition will become even sharper and more accurate.
  - and attempt to reverse engineer it. If your gut says not to make a hire, try to figure out why. You may make a few mistakes learning to trust your gut, but it’s important to develop this ability. -> Learn when to trust your gut and when not to trust your gut (aka instinct, intuition).
- Develop a curiosity about your intuitions. Your intuitions are based in your experiences. Learn to reduce them to writing (as principles) so you can test and refine them. Formalize your thinking and share it to give others the benefit of your insights.

## Other Principles

TODO: Move these under the appropriate principles above rather than as a separate section.

Other sources of inspiration for operating principles include:

- [37signals](https://37signals.com/){:target="\_blank"}
- [The GitLab Handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/){:target="\_blank"}

Rather than reinvent the wheel, here are links to some external principles that resonate with me:

- [37signals — 05. Err on the side of do](https://37signals.com/05/){:target="\_blank"} I am not naturally good at this but have come to agree with this over time.
- [37signals — 19. Pay people, not addresses](https://37signals.com/19/){:target="\_blank"}. I agree with this in part. If you want to build a high achieving team, hire and pay people based on the value they provide, not the zip code where they live.
- [37signals — 12. Hours aren’t equal](https://37signals.com/12/){:target="\_blank"}
- [37signals — 13. On repeat](https://37signals.com/13/){:target="\_blank"} This doesn’t just apply to new ideas. It applies to all important ideas.
- [37signals — 14. Meetings aren’t free](https://37signals.com/14/){:target="\_blank"}
- [37signals — 16. The trap of marginal thinking](https://37signals.com/16/){:target="\_blank"} Whenever possible, buy, don’t build.

- [37signals — 33. Planning is guessing](https://37signals.com/33/){:target="\_blank"}
- [37signals — 34. Sleep on it](https://37signals.com/34/){:target="\_blank"} Never make a big life decision without sleeping on it.
- [37signals — 35. Companies aren’t families](https://37signals.com/35/){:target="\_blank"} Companies aren’t families, but great teams are. Many people spend more time with their coworkers than anyone else, including their immediate family. After spending 10 years at one company, I believe that great teams have all the good and bad that comes with family dynamics. You have the authority figures. You have the teenagers who grow into adults and learn to navigate larger roles. You have the crazy uncles with their hare-brained ideas, the kind, supportive grandparents, and the nurturing parent figures. You disagree. You get your feelings hurt. You part ways at times. And like family, good teams find a way to support each other, provide mutual value, work through conflict, and keep the relationship working over the long term. And like all families, sometimes the bittersweet time comes for someone to move away or to go out on their own.

### Principles & Values from GitLab Handbook

> We value caring for others. Demonstrating we care for people provides an effective framework for challenging directly and delivering feedback. We disagree with companies that say [Evaluate People Accurately, Not “Kindly”](https://inside.bwater.com/publications/principles_excerpt){:target="\_blank"}. We’re all for accurate assessment, but we think it must be done in a kind way. Give as much positive feedback as you can, and do it in a public way.
>
> -- [GitLab Values: Kindness](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#kindness){:target="\_blank"}

I disagree with this dichotomy. People should be evaluated accurately. The most kind feedback is the honest feedback that helps the recipient. Be aware of other circumstances. Don't overwhelm the person when they're struggling. But don't allow them to underperform by failing to give them honest feedback. (And yes, I struggle to apply my own advice. This is why earning trust is so important.)

- **Everyone can remind anyone in the company about our values.** If there is a disagreement about the interpretations, the discussion can be escalated to more people within the company without repercussions.
- Share problems you run into, ask for help, be forthcoming with information and **speak up**.
- All of this. [GitLab Values: Give Feedback Effectively](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#give-feedback-effectively){:target="\_blank"}
- “Give negative feedback in the smallest setting possible. One-on-one video calls are preferred.” “Negative feedback can be given in a group setting if it’s to someone higher in the management chain. This shows that no one is above feedback.” ([GitHub Values: Negative Feedback is 1x1](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#negative-feedback-is-1-1){:target="\_blank"}). Having been on the receiving end of this, I agree almost entirely with the spirit of this; however, truly egregious behavior, especially by those in higher profile roles, should be called out in the forum where it took place to model for everyone that it is not tolerated.
- If you have to remind someone of the position you have in the company, you’re doing something wrong. People already know [our decision-making process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/#making-decisions){:target="\_blank"}. Explain why you’re making the decision, and respect everyone irrespective of their function. This includes using the rank of another person - [including the CEO](https://twitter.com/EmiliejayG/status/1198731054162432000){:target="\_blank"} - to sell an idea or decision.

> While I agree with this, I’ve been surprised to encounter people who don’t understand who’s responsible for making various decisions or who think they have more authority than they do. Usually this is due to a communication failure by leadership. In these cases, it’s sometimes necessary to reiterate your role. (Also, don’t be the one who makes someone else have to do that!)

**Address behavior, but don’t label people**

> There is a lot of good in [this article](http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/10/the_no_asshole_.html){:target="\_blank"} about not wanting jerks on our team, but <mark>we believe that _jerk_ is a label for behavior rather than an inherent classification of a person. We avoid classifications.</mark> > [GitLab Values: Address behavior, but don’t label people](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#address-behavior-but-dont-label-people){:target="\_blank"}

I wholeheartedly agree with this. While part of a manager’s job is to change bad behavior over time, I maintain that it’s not worth the effort when it comes to people who have a severe lack of emotional intelligence, are extremely negative, and show little desire to improve. The amount of time and energy required is better spent elsewhere.

**Say sorry**

> If you made a mistake, apologize as soon as possible. <mark>Saying sorry is not a sign of weakness but one of strength. The people that do the most work will likely make the most mistakes.</mark>
>
> [GitLab Values: Say Sorry](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#say-sorry){:target="\_blank"}

> “In many organizations, there’s a subtle, low-level, persistent pressure to continually prove your worth. And I believe that this fuels imposter syndrome and wreaks havoc on [mental health](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/mental-health/){:target="\_blank"}.” - Darren M.

**Don’t let each other fail**

> Keep an eye out for others who may be struggling or stuck. If you see someone who needs help, reach out and assist, or connect them with someone else who can provide expertise or assistance. We succeed and shine together!
> [GitLab Values: Don't let each other fail](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#dont-let-each-other-fail){:target="\_blank"}

> The best teams don’t say they’re “flat”—they become that way culturally because the people who make up the team feel invested in the company. They feel willing to own problems and decisions and to speak up regardless of rank or hierarchy. When people at every level feel this way, they are more willing to take risks, push the limit, try new projects, and not wait to get things done.

**Good employee recognition is specific and timely.**

> Don’t wait to make someone feel recognized for something great they accomplished. In other words: <mark>Send a short note instead of waiting to edit a long one.</mark> As in product development, employee recognition can happen in sprints. Move fast and praise quickly.
>
> [How a Founder’s Mentality Encourages Employee Recognition](https://conscious.org/how-a-founders-mentality-encourages-employee-recognition/){:target="\_blank"}

> Founders fail. They fail _all the time_. <mark>And employees need to feel empowered and even recognized for big risks that don’t work out in addition to big wins that do.</mark> Part of being a Conscious Company means accepting that failure is necessary for success; that’s why our operating value of Be 20% Wrong, Chase 10x is important.

**Blameless problem solving**

> Investigate mistakes in a way that focuses on the situational aspects of a failure’s mechanism and the decision-making process that led to the failure, rather than cast blame on a person or team. We hold blameless [root cause analyses](https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/){:target="\_blank"} and [retrospectives](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/management/group-retrospectives/){:target="\_blank"} for stakeholders to speak up without fear of punishment or retribution.
