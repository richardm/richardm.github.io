# Done is Better than Perfect

> **_Perfectionists sacrifice the progress that matters most for improvement at the margin._** --Unknown

> **_If you wait to ship until something is perfect, you’ve waited too long._** --Unknown

> “Doing the correct thing poorly is worth more than executing the wrong things perfectly.” -Unknown (via [David Fallarme on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dfallarme_it-was-the-weirdest-thing-my-ceo-ever-told-activity-7039610791863427075-PqP5/){:target="\_blank"})

> A good idea executed poorly is better than a bad idea executed perfectly.

> “Workaholics don’t actually accomplish more than nonworkaholics. They may claim to be perfectionists, but that just mean they’re wasting time fixating on inconsequential details instead of moving on to the next task.” - Jason Fried

> Ship as soon as the value you deliver exceeds the pain of using it.

<!-- Just publish what you have. Publish drafts. Publish it unorganized. You can spend forever organizing and editing. Get your ideas out there early and iterate. Done is better than perfect. -->

Note: This is not a universal rule--some things do need to be perfect (or close)--but it’s an effective principle for shipping an MVP, encouraging iteration, and making progress when you’re stuck.
