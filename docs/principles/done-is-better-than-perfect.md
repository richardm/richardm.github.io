# Done is Better than Perfect

> **_Perfectionists sacrifice the progress that matters most for improvement at the margin._** --Unknown

> **_If you wait to ship until something is perfect, you’ve waited too long._** --Unknown

> “Doing the correct thing poorly is worth more than executing the wrong things perfectly.” -Unknown (via David Fallarme on LinkedIn)

> A good idea executed poorly is better than a bad idea executed perfectly.

Just publish what you have. Publish drafts. Publish it unorganized. You can spend forever organizing and editing. Get your ideas out there early and iterate. Done is better than perfect.

> Note: This is not a universal rule--some things do need to be perfect (or close)--but it’s an effective principle to break through when you’re stuck.
