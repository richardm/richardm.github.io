# Principle: Done is better than Perfect

> **_Perfectionists sacrifice the progress that matters most for improvement at the margin._** --Unknown

**_If you wait to ship until something is perfect, you’ve waited too long._**

Just publish what you have. Publish drafts. Publish it unorganized. You can spend forever organizing and editing. Get your ideas out there early and iterate. Done is better than perfect.

> Note: This is not a universal rule--some things do need to be perfect (or close)--but it’s an effective principle to break through when you’re stuck.
