# Done is Better than Perfect

<!-- Just publish what you have. Publish drafts. Publish it unorganized. You can spend forever organizing and editing. Get your ideas out there early and iterate. Done is better than perfect. -->

Note: This is not a universal rule--some things do need to be perfect (or close)--but it’s an effective principle for shipping an MVP, encouraging iteration, and making progress when you’re stuck.
