# Maximize employee engagement

It is possible to use negative reinforcement to get people to do the minimum necessary to avoid punishment, but that won't give you a sustained competitive advantage.

The goal should be to maximize results, not to achieve the minimum results necessary, and this is only possible by maximizing employee engagement.

**Attrition is just a more severe form of disengagement.** Focus on improving engagement.
