# Leadership is communication

- Communicate a vision. Communicate needs. Communicate challenges. Communicate principles. Communicate expectations.
- The more important the information, the more it must be repeated. Say it different ways, in different contexts, and in different mediums.
- It’s _usually_ better to communicate the key point inelegantly than to delay the message until you can polish it. But know when that’s not the case. (See: [Done is better than perfect](/principles/done-is-better-than-perfect).)
- Communicate what you’re going to do before you do it--with your boss so they are in the loop and can sign off, and with your team, so they can provide feedback.
