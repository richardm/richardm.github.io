# Assume Good Intent

> "We judge ourselves by our intentions, but we judge others by their actions." [Source](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/03/19/judge-others)

**Assume positive intent**

> <mark>We naturally have a double standard when it comes to the actions of others. We blame circumstances for our own mistakes, but individuals for theirs.</mark> This double standard is called the Fundamental Attribution Error. In order to mitigate this bias, you should always assume positive intent in your interactions with others, respecting their expertise and giving them grace in the face of what you might perceive as mistakes.

This concept is borrowed from argue the “steel man” technique.

A good “steel” position is one where the other person feels you’ve represented their position well, even if they still disagree with your assumptions or conclusion.

If you can strengthen someone’s own argument before dismantling it, it has a compelling effect.
