# Be kind, not nice.

The problem with being "nice":

- Nice people are often not really nice at all because they avoid saying the things that most need to be said.
- Ruinous empathy is nice but it’s not kind.
- It’s unkind to the person to withhold the constructive criticism they need most. It’s also unkind to deliver that feedback poorly.

The solution:

- Remember, that being nice can be very unkind.
