# Just start

Stop waiting for motivation. It's a fallacy that motivation leads to action. The truth is that action leads to motivation. Stop talking about it and start doing it.

You learn and get good at what you do. (Tanya Reilly?)

"You will only get better at what you spend time on." - Tanya Reilly
