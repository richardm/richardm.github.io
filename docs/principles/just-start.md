# Just start

> "The greatest lesson that I learned in all of this is that you have to start. Start now. Start here. Start small. Keep it simple." - Jack Dorsey

> “What you do is what matters, not what you think or say or plan.” - Jason Fried

Stop waiting for motivation. It's a fallacy that motivation leads to action. The truth is that action leads to motivation. Stop talking about it and start doing it.

You learn and get good at what you do. (Tanya Reilly?)
