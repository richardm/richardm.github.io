## Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.

> Unless it's truly a matter of survival, take the time to slow down and invest in your CI/CD and test automation.

Examples of slow is smooth, and smooth is fast:

- Slowing down to create a CI pipeline before building a project
- Slowing down to create a CD pipeline to deploy a Hello World page before building actual features
- Slowing down to setup a local dev environment with auto-reload
- Slowing down feature delivery to require tests be written for every new feature before code goes live. While it slows you down up-front, it reduces manual regression testing effort permanently.

There are always justifications provided for not slowing down:

- The startup is on the brink of bankruptcy
- The initiative has to get done by EOY so some executive meets their goals
- We will lose a major client if the initiative is not delivered X date
- It's just a proof of concept

_Sometimes_ cutting corners are legitimately a question of survival, but often, these reasons are used to justify ignoring mounting technical debt. Worse, they are sometimes imposed by short-sighted engineering managers who don't understand the true impact of these decisions on engineering velocity.

A better question is whether the runway is long enough to receive a payoff on the effort invested.

The problem is most successful proofs of concept become production code that has to be maintained.
