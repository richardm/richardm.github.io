# Don't point fingers

People are your biggest asset. People are your best chance of fixing things. And people inevitably make mistakes. Our processes exist to prevent catastrophic mistakes. Too many or too bureaucratic processes can also interfere with our ability to work effectively. Processes should be balanced to prevent serious issues without unnecessarily interfering with day to day work.
