I have over 200 books on my to-read list. As a result, I generally start by reading book summaries and then read the full book if I find the summary useful. I am a slow reader because I generally take the time to capture notes for each chapter as I read. My goal is to never have to read the same book twice; however, I read some of my book notes dozens of times. My hope is these summaries will introduce you to concepts and encourage you to read the full book.

## Book Summaries

A incomplete list of the books I've read in recent years. I have extensive book notes for _most_ of these, although they need cleanup before sharing. Over time, I plan to share my book notes here as a resource for others. If you would like me to escalate a particular book, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/richardm/richardm.github.io/issues){:target="\_blank"}.
