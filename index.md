## Software Engineering Leadership Handbook

> “The most important thing is that you develop your own principles and ideally write them down, especially if you are working with others.” - Ray Dalio

I started writing down my principles in 2021 after reading [Principles by Ray Dalio](https://www.principles.com/principles/418eaeca-564f-41e8-bd90-8e0d042f28d5/#table-of-contents){:target="\_blank"}. These principles reflect my current opinions based on a combination of experience and reading. Because these began as personal notes on my computer, I was not disciplined about noting sources as I captured ideas. Over time, I will try to identify and cite sources.

Most of my thoughts here are related to [software development](/software-engineering-best-practices/), [leadership](principles/), [investing](/investing), and [psychology](/psychology).

Most ideas are derivative, including these. Share them freely. Principles should be tested and refined. If you have feedback, disagreement, or suggestions, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/richardm/richardm.github.io/issues){:target="\_blank"}. If you take the time to read this, I value your feedback and perspective.

> **Work In Progress**: Please note this is a rough draft. Expect changes and check back often for additional content! As a perfectionist, I would prefer to keep it private until perfect, but [done is better than perfect](/principles/done-is-better-than-perfect).
