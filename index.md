## Software Engineering Leadership Handbook

> “The most important thing is that you develop your own principles and ideally write them down, especially if you are working with others.” - Ray Dalio

In 2002, I began my software engineering career as an intern at Electronic Clearing House (now Intuit). Over the following two decades, I worked as a backend engineer, a frontend engineer, and now as an engineering manager, where I lead culture and architecture for an organization of 70+ engineers.

I started writing down my principles in 2021 after reading [Principles by Ray Dalio](https://www.principles.com/principles/418eaeca-564f-41e8-bd90-8e0d042f28d5/#table-of-contents). These principles reflect my current opinions based on a combination of life experience and reading. Because these began as personal notes on my computer, I was not disciplined about noting sources as I captured ideas. Over time, I will try to identify and cite sources.

Most of my thoughts here are related to software development, leadership, investing, and psychology.

**Most ideas are derivative**, including these. Share them freely.

> **Work In Progress**: Please note this is a rough draft. As a perfectionist, I would prefer to keep it private until perfect, but [done is better than perfect](/principles/done-is-better-than-perfect).

Principles should be tested and refined. If you have feedback, disagreement, or suggestions, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/richardm/richardm.github.io/issues). If you take the time to read this, I value your feedback and perspective.
