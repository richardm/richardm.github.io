# Content Pages

Jekyll supports `.md`, `.markdown`, and `.html` files for website content. Always use Markdown unless there is a technical limitation that requires HTML. Always ask for permission before switching to HTML for a page.

## Markdown Rules

- All markdownfiles should have an .md extension
- Every page must begin with front matter as defined below.

## Front Matter Rules
- Every markdown file must contain a frontmatter section with the following fields:
- permalink: Always specify a permalink (relative from domain root) so that we don't break inbound links if we move files around. Do not modify an existing permalink unless explicitly instructed.
- layout: `about` | `home` | `page` | `post`
- title: Every page must specify a title. This shows in the site navigation so it should be relatively short (maximum 4-5 words, ideally less)

Some notes:
- Most content pages should use the "page" layout
- Blog posts should use the "post" layout

## Callouts

This website supports callouts which are defined in _config.yml. The following codeblocks provide examples:

A paragraph which shows as highlighted:
```
{: .highlight}
A paragraph
```

A note:
```
{: .note}
A note here
```

#### A note with a title:
```
{: .note-title}
My note title

My note contents
```
Output: Renders a callout with a title of "My note title" and body of "My note contents".
