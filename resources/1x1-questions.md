# 1x1 Questions

# Recurring 1x1 Questions to Ask:

It helps to have a list of 1x1 questions to draw from. Here are some of my fallbacks:

- Is there anything that should be on our roadmap that’s not currently?
- What do you want to do but don’t feel like you have the time for?
- How can I best support you this week?
- What is one thing we can improve in the team?
- What’s frustrating you about your work these days?
- What do you need from me to be successful?
- What can I do better?
