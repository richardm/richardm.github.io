# Recurring 1x1 Questions

## General principles

- One on ones are best when they create alignment, facilitate career development, and provide support
- One on ones are not meant for project updates (although in the absense of an agenda, that tends to be inevitable)

## Questions to ask peers or reports

Generally, the subordinate is supposed to own the agenda for a one on one call, but that does not always happen. It's helpful to have a list of questions to draw from to spark conversation during 1x1s.

Here are some I've found useful:

- Is there anything that should be on our team roadmap that’s not currently?
- What do you want to do but don’t feel like you have the time for?
- How can I best support you this week?
- What is one thing we can improve in the team?
- What’s frustrating you about your work these days?
- What do you need from me to be successful?
- What can I do better?

## Questions to ask your manager (or a skip-level)

- What are your top priorities right now?
- What do you spend most of your time thinking about these days?
- TODO
